## 🌟 Featured Projects

### [LearnGami](http://learngami.com) - Gamified e-Learning Platform
*Coming Soon - Stay Tuned*

Check out [NearGami.com](http://neargami.com) for the initial version and stay tuned for the transformation.

*More Details Coming Soon*

### [AnalyzicAI](https://analyzicai.com) - AI-Powered Analysis Ecosystem
*Pre-Alpha*

**AnalyzicAI** is an umbrella ecosystem of specialized AI-powered analysis tools that leverage multi-agent iterative rethinking consensus (combining **OpenAI GPT**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic Claude**) to deliver bias-reduced, expert-level auditing.

**The Ecosystem:**
- 📜 **[SolidicAI](https://solidicai.com)** — Advanced smart contract analysis and security auditing platform.
- 🖼️ **[UXicAI](https://uxicai.com)** — Intelligent UI/UX design analysis platform providing comprehensive visual and usability feedback.
- 💡 **Your Domain Here** — Interested in analysis tools for legal cases, medical data, or other domains? [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/web3web4/analyzicai/issues) to suggest it!

**Why Multi-Provider AI Consensus?**  
By orchestrating multiple top-tier AI models through a sophisticated multi-step pipeline (Initial Analysis → Iterative Cross-Provider Rethink → Master Synthesis), AnalyzicAI overcomes the limitations, hallucinations, and biases of any single AI provider. This ensures highly accurate, reliable, and comprehensive analysis results.

### [TACoSec](https://github.com/web3web4/tacosec-frontend) - Secure Secret Stashing and Sharing

A privacy-first utility for managing sensitive data with **threshold encryption** and end-to-end security, powered by [NuCypher TACo](https://taco.build).

**Key Features:**
- 🔐 Client-side threshold encryption (Ferveo, BLS12-381, MPC)
- 🔑 Time-based access control and address-based permissions
- 💬 Secure encrypted replies and audit trails
- 👤 Optional Max Privacy Mode (zero metadata retention)

**Built with:** React, TypeScript, ethers.js, Telegram Mini Apps
